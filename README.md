# Online-Recruitment-Fraud-Detection-Using-Deep-Learning-Approaches

## 📖 Project Overview
Online recruitment platforms are increasingly targeted by fraudsters who post fake job advertisements to scam job seekers.  
This project proposes a deep learning based system to detect fraudulent job postings using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and transformer-based models such as BERT and RoBERTa.

The system classifies job postings as **Real Job** or **Fraudulent Job** based on textual content and related features.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- To analyze online job postings for fraudulent patterns  
- To preprocess and clean textual job data using NLP  
- To apply deep learning models (BERT & RoBERTa) for classification  
- To evaluate the system using standard performance metrics  
- To provide a web-based interface for prediction

## 🧠 Methodology
1. Data collection from publicly available datasets  
2. Text preprocessing (tokenization, stop-word removal, lemmatization)  
3. Feature extraction using BERT and RoBERTa embeddings  
4. Model training and evaluation  
5. Fraud prediction using a web-based interface
